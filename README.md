# Pong
Yet another pong clone

## Controls

* Left paddle is controlled via mouse

## To-Do

* Add a scoreboard
* Add a "PAUSED" overlay when the game is paused
* Implement a menu screen
  * Difficulty selection
  * Allow Human or CPU selection for each paddle
* Make AI less jittery
  * Possibly redo AI to predict the ball's path,
    rather than just track its Y position
